<h1>Best Movies According To Linnet</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All The Time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Train To Busan</h3>
 <p>An interesting Zombie movie!! At first I disliked the main lead character Gong Yoo (Seok woo), he appeared self-centered and rigid, but by the progress of the movie a softer character emerges. A father trying to protect his child, and a man with empathy who is ready to extend a hand for the others. 
    All cast were amazing, especially the wonderful Ma Dong Seok (Sang Hwa), with such talent, it is no doubt that he is one of the most bankable actors in South Korea right now. The child young actress acting skills showed what a great potential she has and Jung Yu-Mi (Sung Gyeong) was a perfect cast for this movie. 
    The Zombie make up and the special effects used were on spot, the cinematography, action, camera movement etc were really good. 
    It's a highly recommended movie</p>
<h3>Pursuit Of Happyness</h3>
<p>"Pursuit of Happyness" is a very warm and above all, a very inspiring story about family, determination, and never letting go of one's dream. Very few people, I think, could or would have tolerated what Gardner did in order to make a better life for himself and his son. The two were homeless on and off, and those scenes are devastating. The apprentice program takes 20 people, and only one is chosen, yet Chris goes for it, bringing everything he owns to work when he had no place to live. How he holds it together and talks to clients and makes contacts is incredible. Frankly, if this weren't a true story, I would still have liked it but wondered how possible any of it even was.

<h3>Dangal</h3>
<p>DANGAL is a masterpiece. A terrific film that stays in your heart and remains etched in your memory much after the screening has concluded. A brilliant film that restores your faith in Hindi cinema. Actually, it won't be erroneous to state that DANGAL is the finest film to come out of the Hindi film industry in a long, long time and mark my words, it will be remembered as a classic in times to come. It blends drama, emotions, sportsmanship and patriotism extraordinarilyÂ… the icing on the cake being Aamir Khan's towering act. This rich-in-merits film has a major advantage too -- the holidays ahead Christmas and New Year -- which will ensure a glorious run at the ticket counters. A must, must watch!</p>
